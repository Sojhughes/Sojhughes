### Hello! I am Sojhughes! A little about myself, using Github's supplied prompts:

-I am currently enrolled in an AWS, where I hope to learn about Cloud services and find an engaging career within that path. 
-Things I aim to learn by the end of this year: Linux, JSON, Microsoft Azure 
-Things I aim to learn by the end of next year: Python, some other programming language
-Things I don't aim to learn: Trigonometry
- ðŸ’¬ As of now, ask me about anything that has to do with Overwatch, Apex, Anime, and nothing to do with math. In future, I dearly hope to be knowledgeable enough to be able to say I could be asked about anything to do with Cloud Services and Networking.
-Pronouns: She
- Fun fact: I own two 15 year old turtles and a large goldendoodle and all three of them are Bums.
- ***Will revise this later
